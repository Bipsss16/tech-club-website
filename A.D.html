           <p class="flow-text">In the 2016 Fall semester, the United Tech Club was founded by a small group of IST students. In the time since, the club has taken an active role on campus and in the community by hosting technology workshops and partnering with other clubs to host fundraising events.</p>
           <br>
           <p class="flow-text">Our club aspires to provide an area for students to learn new technology, build team skills, and expand their technical skills by working on projects and hosting guest speakers. We would love to see more attendance at weekly meetings and our events, and plan to inspire students to pursue their passions in technology.</p>
           <br>
           <p class="flow-text">The club aims to increase our volume of speakers on topics that pertain to our field of study, and our executive members are open to suggestion.</p>
           <br>
           <p class="flow-text">We would appreciate all who would come share their experiences in the IT and software development fields as well as past or present projects that would enhance our knowledge. Please send us an email.</p>
